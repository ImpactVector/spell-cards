An unofficial spell card generator for tabletop games involving large lizards living in underground structures. Works with most any edition that has spells.

No data files are included in either the code or the application download.

Requires .NET Framework 4.0 and Microsoft Report Viewer 2010 SP1 Redistributable

Note: Do NOT use the code in this project as any kind of a tutorial on how to write an application, WPF or otherwise. It's basically a pile of spaghetti. The only reason I posted it at all is because I really liked the way the cards turned out and thought someone else might also get some use out of it.
